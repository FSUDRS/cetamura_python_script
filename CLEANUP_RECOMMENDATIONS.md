# Repository Cleanup Recommendations

## Completed Actions

1. **Updated .gitignore** to exclude:
   - Additional virtual environment patterns (`.venv_*`)
   - `temp_release_test/` directory
   - `origin_src_main.py` file
   - All PyInstaller spec files (`Cetamura_*.spec`)

2. **Removed redundant files**:
   - `src/ipaddress.py` (confirmed unnecessary in previous steps)
   - `origin_src_main.py` (redundant since we have `src/main.py`)
   - Root directory log files (`batch_process_summary.log`, `batch_tool.log`)

## Additional Cleanup Script

A cleanup script has been created at `cleanup_repo.ps1` that will:

1. Remove redundant Python files (if any were missed)
2. Clean up log files
3. Prompt for removal of the `temp_release_test` directory
4. Prompt for cleanup of build directories
5. Prompt for removal of `__pycache__` directories

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Review the changes made to the .gitignore file
2. Run the cleanup script to interactively remove additional unneeded files:
   ```powershell
   .\cleanup_repo.ps1
   ```
3. Commit the cleanup changes:
   ```bash
   git add .gitignore
   git add -u  # Stage deleted files
   git commit -m "Clean up repository: remove redundant files and update .gitignore"
   ```
4. Merge to main branch or create a pull request

## Future Maintenance Recommendations

1. Keep build artifacts out of version control
2. Maintain the `.gitignore` file as new patterns emerge
3. Periodically clean up temporary files and directories
4. Consider adding a pre-commit hook that prevents committing files that match gitignore patterns
