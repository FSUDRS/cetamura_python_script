# Phased Implementation Guide for CI/CD

This document outlines a phased approach to implementing CI/CD for the Cetamura Batch Tool project, allowing you to gradually integrate continuous integration and delivery practices into your development workflow.

## Phase 1: Basic CI Setup (Current)

**Goal:** Establish automated testing on each code change.

**Components:**
- Basic GitHub Actions workflow
- Automated testing with pytest
- Test execution on multiple Python versions

**Implementation:**
- Created .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Set up matrix testing for Python 3.9 and 3.11
- Configured workflow to run on pushes to main/master and pull requests

**Validation:**
- Push a small change to trigger the workflow
- Verify tests execute successfully in GitHub Actions

## Phase 2: Improved Testing and Analysis

**Goal:** Enhance code quality through expanded testing and analysis.

**Tasks:**
1. Add code coverage reporting
   - Install pytest-cov
   - Configure GitHub Actions to generate and upload coverage reports
   - Add coverage badges to README.md

2. Integrate code quality tools
   - Add flake8 for linting
   - Add mypy for type checking
   - Configure pre-commit hooks for local quality checks

**Implementation Example for Coverage:**
Add to ci.yml:
```yaml
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: |
    python -m pytest --cov=cetamura --cov-report=xml tests/

- name: Upload coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    file: ./coverage.xml
    fail_ci_if_error: false
```

## Phase 3: Build Automation

**Goal:** Automate building of executables for distribution.

**Tasks:**
1. Refine PyInstaller configuration
   - Ensure spec files are optimized
   - Configure for different build types (onedir/onefile)
   
2. Implement build versioning
   - Automatically inject version info into builds
   - Create versioned build artifacts

3. Configure artifact storage
   - Store build artifacts from CI runs
   - Implement retention policies for artifacts

## Phase 4: Automated Releases

**Goal:** Streamline the release process with automation.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement semantic versioning
   - Document versioning scheme
   - Create version management scripts

2. Configure release triggers
   - Refine tag-based release process
   - Implement automatic changelog generation

3. Set up release validation
   - Add smoke tests for packaged executables
   - Verify installer scripts

## Phase 5: Deployment and Distribution

**Goal:** Extend pipeline to handle deployment and distribution.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement update mechanisms
   - Add self-update capability to application
   - Create update notification system

2. Configure distribution channels
   - Set up automated uploads to distribution servers
   - Implement signing for releases

3. Create environment-specific deployment flows
   - Configure staging deployments
   - Implement production deployment safeguards

## Phase 6: Monitoring and Optimization

**Goal:** Add monitoring and continuously improve the pipeline.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement performance metrics
   - Track build times
   - Monitor test execution times

2. Add application telemetry
   - Crash reporting
   - Usage analytics (opt-in)

3. Optimize workflows
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Refine workflow triggers for efficiency

## Implementation Checklist

For each phase:

1. **Plan**
   - Review the specific requirements for each task
   - Identify dependencies and prerequisites
   - Document expected outcomes

2. **Implement**
   - Make necessary configuration changes
   - Create or update workflow files
   - Add required tools and dependencies

3. **Test**
   - Verify workflow execution
   - Validate expected outcomes
   - Test failure scenarios and recovery

4. **Document**
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Create guides for team members
   - Document lessons learned

5. **Review**
   - Gather feedback on implementation
   - Assess performance and reliability
   - Identify opportunities for improvement

## Next Steps

To continue with Phase 2, focus on:

1. Adding code coverage to your test setup
2. Implementing basic linting
3. Setting up pre-commit hooks for local quality checks

This phased approach ensures you can gradually build up your CI/CD capabilities while maintaining a stable development environment.
